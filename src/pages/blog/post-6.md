Mel-Lofi is a free virtual instrument plugin (ROMpler) for digital audio workstations on Windows and macOS.

This virtual instrument is based on the Mellotron multi-samples recorded by Taijiguy (+ 1 “invented” preset) and brings a total of 24 presets distributed across 5 main instrument categories.

All the samples were slightly edited and most important, were looped for best playability. But even so, the sound remains rough and lo-fi, we wanted to keep the feel and sound of the original instrument.

As an extra, we added 4 original effect layers: vinyl, radio noise, mechanical belt noise, and rain. They each have on/off buttons and volume sliders, also they’re labeled with their corresponding note on the keyboard.

The interface is easy to use and understand, coming with global volume & pan, a velocity knob, attack/decay envelope, cutoff filter, modulation section, and effects such as delay, chorus, distortion with cabinet, and reverb.

Mel-Lofi can be used in Lo-Fi Hip Hop, Ambient, Chillout, Pop, EDM, and other similar styles. It is available in 64-bit VST/VST3 Windows and VST/VST3/AU macOS.
